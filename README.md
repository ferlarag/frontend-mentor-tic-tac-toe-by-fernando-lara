## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that itâ€™s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so itâ€™s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) - A Testing JS Library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - A CSS Extension Language

### What I learned

I used this challenge as an oportunity to practice what I've learned so far in the Meta Front-End Developer Certification in Coursera. Some of the techniques and technologies I've come to love are Jest and Test Driven Design (TDD).

I also learned about the concepts behind the Minimax algorithm. I still don't know how I pulled that one up! The result? An unbeatable CPU player.


### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable with TDD. I used to use console.log for everything (don't get me wrong, I still use it ðŸ˜‚). Jest is a huge part of my workflow, but I still feel like I'm just scratching the tip of the iceberg!
